        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Many people use cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox to keep files in sync between their computers, phones, and tablets. However, this isn't always the most efficient or secure solution. In addition to legitimate privacy and security concerns with storing all your data on a third-party server, especially with free services, you would end up paying a hefty price for them.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            So, what's the alternative for syncing? You can use a program like <a href="https://syncthing.net/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-semibold underline">Syncthing</a>. Instead of using an unknown cloud server for storing your data, Syncthing connects your devices directly to each other, creating a private, encrypted network for file synchronization. This means your data is never passed to a third-party server, giving you complete control and privacy. Moreover, Syncthing is an open-source tool available on most platforms, including mobile devices. An advantage of using an open-source application is that the code that runs on your devices are publicly <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-semibold underline">available</a> to examine. They also conduct audits and bug bounty programs, challenging the public to find issues in the code repository. In simpler terms, they are significantly trustworthy than any closed-source software.

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            If your goal is to sync your files across your devices, it is highly recommended because:

                    You just don’t sync the file, you can configure file versioning with various specifications, and a configurable trash can to recover anything that are deleted before. This helps to revert to your working files when something goes wrong.

                    Whether it is a downtime of the cloud provider or they decided to close the company, you end up losing the service (or your entire data) because of the cloud provider. With Syncthing, you get to avoid such dependencies with the cloud provider.

        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-6">
            While Syncthing is excellent for syncing, cloud storage still has a purpose. It's the right choice when you need files to be easily accessible on any device, and especially when you need to share files with others. For example, if you need to share a project with a collaborator or send a document to a friend, cloud storage services make it simple to generate a shareable link. Hence, the decision must be made according to your requirement. However, if the need is to just sync your files and have them available across your devices, Syncthing might be a better option than opting a cloud.
