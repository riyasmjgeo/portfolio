<h1>Tidy your email easily</h1> 

In the era of data becoming the new gold, we are surrounded by cyber-sniffers waiting for a bad click to steal your data. Despite having laws, there can be moments when we lack other options than feeding your private data to the Internet. While there are serious threats, the silliest of them is getting your inbox flooded with spam messages. If you are someone who wish to get internet services without exposing your inbox for the spammers, this might help you!
<h2>Prevention is better than cure</h2>

The best way to avoid email spammers is not share your email for them to reach you. Two easiest ways to achieve that are by using temporary email and by using aliases. 

<h3>Temporary Emails</h3>

Services like [10minutemail](https://10minutemail.com) provide temporary email addresses that expire and are deleted after just 10 minutes. You can use these for website registrations that require email verification. Any confirmation links or codes sent to this temporary address will be accessible to you for those 10 minutes, giving you enough time to complete the account setup. 

<h3>Email Alias</h3>

While temporary email addresses are convenient, some websites are smart enough to identify them and block from using it. Moreover, they are not suggested for sensitive information since you are unaware of what happens to the temporary email you just created. Also, if you wish to receive an email in future from the service you registered, you can’t access it since the email would have flushed out. In these cases, the best solution is to mask your actual email address and use an alias.

An email alias is another email address than your actual email address, but any email sent to the alias email address will be received in your actual email address. So, if you create a new account in a website using the alias email address, you receive all their emails in your inbox. Simply using an alias will not help you to avoid spamming. But you can deactivate your alias email addressed temporarily and block future emails. When there is a need to receive an email, simply activate it and deactivate after receiving the email you seek. While the description, might make you feel that the task is too technical or tedious, it is mostly a single click task to toggle the alias on or off!

While privacy-focusing email providers such as tuta or protonmail recommend using alias email addresses and provide them by themselves, it is not surprising that most popular email providers won’t tell you about this because they are running by selling our data! However, there are services such as  [Adguard Temp Mail](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-temp-mail/overview.html) and [addy](https://addy.io) providing you such facility by using any email address as the primary (i.e. original) email address and let you create alias email addresses. While creating a new email address for each account can be cumbersome, I recommend making alias such as <i>shopping@xyz.com</i> and <i>entertainment@abc.com</i> and use them to categorize the accounts you create over the Internet. Thereby, you will know which one to toggle on to receiver the email you are expecting.

Another use case of these alias email addresses is making email rules to channel the incoming emails as you want. For example, you can have a folder in your mailbox, in which everything gets deleted automatically in a week. Once you configure such a folder, make a rule stating all incoming emails that is sent to a specific (for example, <i>entertainment@abc.com</i>) email address should be moved to that folder and don’t trigger a notification for that email. This one-time configuration will provide you the ability to avoid the nuisance of email spamming completely but having access to them when you needed them.

<h2>Email rules and filters</h2>

Eemail rules are good to avoid future email spamming. But what to do with existing ones? You can use email filters to find existing spam emails, take necessary action (such as delete them, move them to specific folder), and channel future spams as you wanted by creating email rules. The way you set up an email rules varies according to the email provider you use. However, searching for <i>‘rules’</i> in the settings will show the option and it will guide you through steps to implement your inbox rule. 

<h2>Don’t become your own villain</h2>

In addition to spammers all over the internet, sometimes we choke our inbox ourselves by uploading large files in it. When someone sign up for an email account, there will be a limited storage allotted to the account and it will be a shared among all services accessed get via the account. For example, when you use Gmail, the allocated storage is shared by all google services you access with that account, such as GDrive, Google Photos, Gmail, even the contact list in your android phone is stored on this shared storage. Thereby, when you attach large files in an email you sent and unless you delete that from your email, it permanently occupies a large space in your shared cloud storage. To avoid this, use services like [Lufi](https://upload.disroot.org), that stores your large file and provides a link to access them. When you share the link instead of attaching the file, the recipient can access them directly with a click and avoid chocking the storage of the sender and the recipient. Moreover, you get to use additional security features such as password protecting the file and remove the file after first download or after a defined number of days.
